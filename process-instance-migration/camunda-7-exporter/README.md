# Camunda 7 Process Instance Exporter

This library should export active process instances from Camunda Platform 7 to a
given format, that is perfectly prepared for a smooth import into Camunda
Platform 8.

The library should expose a REST API to export the data.

It should be able to export a huge number of process instances as soon as
possible.
